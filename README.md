This project documents the technical details of Amazon Dash Button for those who want to tap into the potential of this simple IoT device.

The Dash Button is a device that allows customers to re-order items from Amazon by pressing a single button. The Dash Button connects home WiFi network and every time the button is pressed, an order for a certain item will be placed.

The indented usage couldn't be simpler. However, the hardware inside is a lot more powerful than its price suggests ($5, or $1 at the beginning of the trail). The button has a 120MHz Cortex M3 microcontroller with 1M flash and 128K RAM, I2S digital microphone, 16Mb SPI flash memory, RGB LED, Broadcom WiFi module, and runs off a single AAA battery. 

In the past few days I have been exploring and documenting the technical details of this device, which will be updated here as I go on.
